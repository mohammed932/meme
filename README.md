# MemeMe-2.0
Second part of Second Project for iOS Nanodegree by Udacity

## Project Overview
Students have created an app that enables a user to take a picture, and add text at the top and bottom to form a meme, and share that meme on Facebook and Twitter and also by SMS or email. In this project, sent memes will appear in a tab view with two tabs: a table view and a collection view.

## Why this project?
MemeMe covers many of the major UI components found in essentially every app. It combines them with the camera and social media activity view to create a fun and personal user experience.

## What Will I learn?
* Set up a navigation structure that creates an intuitive flow through the app
* Build tables with datasources and delegates
* Create custom table view cells
* Implement user interfaces with tab views and collection views
* Why is this project meaningful to my career?
* Becoming comfortable using all of the key components of UIKit is an essential step in becoming an iOS developer.
* Understanding UIKit allows a developer to make educated assumptions about the architecture of apps that they use.
* Mastering UKit fundamentals frees a developer up to learn model-oriented skills like networking and persistence.
